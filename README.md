# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is a game engine made for those that wish to create large, exploration-based text-adventure games with a good amount of interactivty.
Yggdrasil contains files that help developers build these games. These files provides structure that makes it easier for the developers to
create worlds for their players to explore. Because this engine is for web-based games, it uses HTML as the interface and Javascript for the 
programming side.
